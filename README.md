# Info
This project revolves around using OpenAI's speech-to-text model **Whisper** to transcribe audio into text. 

# Background
Whisper is a lot better at transcribing Swedish audio than the current built-in transcription capabilities of Microsoft Teams. The downside of using whisper is that it doesn't know who's speaking at a given time, unlike Teams which has knowledge of different audio inputs (people in a Teams meeting/call). 


# Installation
You will need to have `whisper` installed on your system to run this code. An installation guide for whisper is available at: https://github.com/openai/whisper.

You will probably also need to have `ffmpeg` installed on your system.
