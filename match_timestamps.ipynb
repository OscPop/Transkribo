    "# Matching timestamps\n",
    "The teams transcriptions come with accurate timestamps for individual speakers since they are using separate microphones. Unfortunately, whisper does not have automatic knowledge of who's saying what. To make up for this, the transcribed speech from whisper is matched with the teams transcription timestamp.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "This is achieved by taking a sentence from the whisper transcription and looking at its timestamp (start/end times). A specific sentence is then assigned the speaker tag of the time section with the most overlapping time from the teams transcription. "
